# POLSCI-150B
Machine Learning for Social Scientists (undergrad / grad course)

This contains course materials for POLSCI 150B: Machine Learning for Social Scientists taught in Winter Quarter 2018 at Stanford Unviersity. 

This course is designed to introduce techniques to collect, analyze, and utilize large collections of data for social science inferences. The ultimate goal of the course is to introduce students to modern machine learning techniques and provide the skills necessary to apply the methods widely.

In achieving this ultimate goal, students will also:
1) Learn about core concepts in machine learning and statistics, developing skills that are transferable to other types of data and inference problems.
2) Develop their programming abilities in R.
3) Be introduced to substantive problems and apply the techniques from the course.
4) Be able to learn independently and tackle more advanced topics and challenges in data analysis.

The course materials were developed with Tongtong Zhang (ttzhang7@stanford.edu) and Rochelle Terman (rterman@uchicago.edu). 

## Please note the course materials are still in development and will be changing.
